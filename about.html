	    	<p class='about-text'>Sigma Eta Pi, founded in 2010 at University of California Los Angeles, is the first entrepreneurship fraternity on the West Coast. Our current chapters (Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, and USC) are complemented by their surrounding startup communities, including Silicon Valley and the emerging Silicon Beach. Brothers of Sigma Eta Pi come from a wide variety of majors and backgrounds, and have started over 21 different ventures. These include one backed by Y-Combinator and acquired by Square for $90 million, five fully funded projects (two by Venture Capital, three by crowd-sourced funding), and the largest hackathon the nation has ever seen.</p>

	    	<p class='about-text'>Our goals are twofold. Firstly, we hope to transform individuals into starters who follow their passions. We achieve this through our semester-long pledge process that emphasizes personal and professional development through hands-on exposure to building a startup. Secondly, we hope to create a tight-knit community of best friends whose relationships will last a lifetime. Many members make some of their best friends through the pledging process, and other friendships emerge out of the time we spend together as a group of friends.</p>
